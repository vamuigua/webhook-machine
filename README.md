# Webhook-machine

A project that implements sending and receiving of Webhooks between 2 laravel apps (Server &amp; Client).

## What does the application do?

The server (api) schedules a job and sends data to the client app (client) through a webhook. When the webhook is received on the client-side app, it processes the request using a job.The job then sends a notification to the user and broadcasts an event using Pusher channels. Finally, the event is captured by Laravel Echo which then provides the necessary data to be updated on the Vue JS frontend in real-time.

You can read more into detail on what the packages do here:
